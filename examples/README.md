# Provenance.io | WalletConnect-JS | WebDemoVanilla

## Run a non-react, plain vanilla js version of walletconnect-js (or use as a reference to setup your own non-react project with wcjs)

### Two vanilla versions to choose from
* ES5
  - Inline scripts, no package.json.  Old school.
* ES6
  - Imports, package.json, npm, and more.
